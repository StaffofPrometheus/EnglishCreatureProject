		Witness 1: <br>
		<p>
		I have worked for Mr. Buford for the past 5 years. He is an extremely rude and stubborn man. I'm lucky I don't directly report to him. Calling him abusive would fit his character easily.
		</p>
		Witness 2: <br>
		<p>
		I used to work in Mr. Buford's company. After surviving a year, I left because I couldn't stand his rude and ungrateful remarks. Whenever he spoke, he'd hurt your soul. It was emotionally painful.
