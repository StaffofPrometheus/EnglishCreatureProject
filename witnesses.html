		Witness 1: <br>
		<p>
		I have known Mr. Buford for a couple of years. He has always been a kind and understanding person. I believe that Mr. Buford is not "abusive" as the accusations say, rather, he is quite the opposite.<br>
		</p>
		Witness 2:<br>
		<p>
		I have known Mr. Buford since high school. He isn't a rude and abusive person. He is a true gentleman, and the accusations of him being "abusive" - I just can't imagine him being abusive.
